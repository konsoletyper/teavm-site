## New WebAssembly backend

This release is mostly driven by development of new WebAssembly backend.
Old WebAssembly backend exists for many years and works well, however, did not see any adoption.
The main reason is that it does not add significant advantages (like performance improvements),
but makes development experience much worse, i.e. does not allow to easily interact with browser JS APIs
and produces large binary files (times as large as JS).

With introduction of new WebAssembly GC proposal these problems were solved.
However, this is not just small addition to original WebAssembly spec, but a game changer,
it was impossible just to improve existing backend to support new proposal.
So the decision was made to create a brand new WebAssembly backend, which would co-exist with the old one.
Perhaps, at some point old WebAssembly backend will be deprecated and fully removed, 
but for now they will co-exist.
However, WebAssembly GC will be advertised as primary WebAssembly target 
and the documentation will be maintained for WebAssembly GC, not for old WebAssembly.

New WebAssembly GC is a bit limited compared to JS backend, but mostly provides all features available
in old WebAssembly backend. Moreover, WebAssembly GC fully supports JSO, as Java-to-JS interaction API.
Hopefully, the next release will cover remaining features and WebAssembly GC backend will be on par with
JS backend and the "experimental" tag will be removed from WebAssembly support.


## Java class library emulation

* Fixed bugs in `BitSet` implementation
* Add `ceilDiv`, `ceilDivExact`, `ceilMod`, `floorDivExact`, `absExact` to `Math` class.


## Support for JS APIs

* Reading files from `<input type="file">`, which includes classes like `File`, `Blob`, `ReadableStream` and so on.
* Binding for `HTMLElement.touch` and `HTMLElement.input` events.
* Binding for [Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API).
* Binding for `Navigator.sendBeacon`
* Binding for `Error.cause`


## Other stuff

* Long emulation was removed from JS runtime. Now JS only relies on 
  [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt), 
  which is supported by all browsers for more than 4 years.
