            <blockquote>
              <p>TeaVM is an ahead-of-time compiler for Java bytecode
                  that emits JavaScript and WebAssembly that runs in 
                  a browser.  Its close relative is the well-known GWT.
                  The main difference is that TeaVM does not require 
                  source code, only compiled class files.
                  Moreover, the source code is not required to be Java, 
                  so TeaVM successfully compiles Kotlin and Scala.
              </p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Easy to use</h3>
            <p>Create a new project from a Maven archetype and develop with pleasure.
                You don't need a complicated setup with npm, Webpack, UglifyJS, Babel, etc.
                TeaVM does everything for you.

            <h3 class="text-center">A powerful web framework included</h3>
            <p>With TeaVM, you can use Flavour, a framework for creating single-page web applications
                in Java, Kotlin or Scala. Templates, components, routing, REST API bindings, and more
                are all built-in.  The experience is quite close to Angular, but the framework
                is based on Java idioms, not JavaScript idioms.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Efficient</h3>
            <p>TeaVM is quite efficient, you won't wait for hours while it's compiling.
                Also, TeaVM produces fast, small JavaScript code for web apps that start quickly, even
                on mobile devices.
